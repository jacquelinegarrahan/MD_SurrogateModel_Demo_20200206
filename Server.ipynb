    "## Project description \n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we will launch a PVAccess server and use its process variables as the inputs and outputs of an online surrogate model. We will then create an application using sliders to control the input process variables, and a number of data views to capture the ouput variables.\n",

    "This notebook is used to set up the PVAccess server. The server is responsible for running callbacks on updated inputs in order to generate model output, and serves the output process variables by PVAccess. This server can also be started from the command line using the command `python bin/cli.py serve start-server pva`.\n",

    "- All variables, (input & output) must have unique names\n",
    "- The output of the model must be configured to run a `predict` method that returns a dictionary mapping process variables to float outputs for single values, and a numpy array for image values. \n",
    "- The image model must contain the static method `prepare_image_from_pv` which contains a post-processing pipeline for the images after collected from the output process variables and before they are displayed in the dashboard. The output of this method must be in the form:\n",
